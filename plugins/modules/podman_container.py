  state:
    description:
      - I(absent) - A container matching the specified name will be stopped and
        removed.
      - I(present) - Asserts the existence of a container matching the name and
        any provided configuration parameters. If no container matches the
        name, a container will be created. If a container matches the name but
        the provided configuration does not match, the container will be
        updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be removed and
        re-created with the requested config. Image version will be taken into
        account when comparing configuration. Use the recreate option to force
        the re-creation of the matching container.
      - I(started) - Asserts there is a running container matching the name and
        any provided configuration. If no container matches the name, a
        container will be created and started. Use recreate to always re-create
        a matching container, even if it is running. Use force_restart to force
        a matching container to be stopped and restarted.
      - I(stopped) - Asserts that the container is first I(present), and then
        if the container is running moves it to a stopped state.
